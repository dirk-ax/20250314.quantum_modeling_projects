# Quantum Modeling Projects for Axiomatic AI

This repository contains proposals and documentation for end-to-end quantum modeling projects developed for Axiomatic AI. The projects focus on creating software frameworks for quantum networks and atom-based quantum computing, with emphasis on formal verification and mathematical consistency.

## Repository Contents

1. **[Quantum Modeling Projects Memo](20250314.quantum_modeling_projects.md)** - Detailed proposals for:
   - Modular Composable Software Framework for Quantum Networks
   - End-to-End Atom-Based Quantum Computing Framework
   - Density Functional Theory (DFT) Framework for Quantum Material Design

2. **[Axiomatic_AI Education Initiative](Axiomatic_AI_Education_Initiative/)** - Program call for the Axiomatic_AI Education Initiative on Truthful and Verifiable AI

## Key Features

- Docker-based deployment for all projects
