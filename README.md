# Quantum Modeling Projects for Axiomatic AI

This repository contains proposals and documentation for end-to-end quantum modeling projects developed for Axiomatic AI. The projects focus on creating software frameworks for quantum networks and atom-based quantum computing, with emphasis on formal verification and mathematical consistency.

## Repository Contents

1. **[Quantum Modeling Projects Memo](20250314.quantum_modeling_projects.md)** - Detailed proposals for:
   - Modular Composable Software Framework for Quantum Networks
   - End-to-End Atom-Based Quantum Computing Framework
   - Density Functional Theory (DFT) Framework for Quantum Material Design

2. **[Axiomatic_AI Education Initiative](Axiomatic_AI_Education_Initiative/)** - Program call for the Axiomatic_AI Education Initiative on Truthful and Verifiable AI

## Collaboration Model and Intellectual Property

This project follows an open collaboration model that respects the intellectual property rights of all contributors:

- **Academic Research**: Work done by external collaborators and their students within an academic context remains theirs. They can maintain their work in their own repositories and receive full academic credit for publications, presentations, and other scholarly outputs.

- **Interface Architecture**: Axiomatic_AI provides the architecture that allows these independent academic projects to interface with and leverage the capabilities of Axiomatic_AI systems, such as AX_CloudTools for physical modeling of photonics, analog electronics, and other components.

- **Commercial Development**: When collaborators are paid by Axiomatic_AI for specific development work, that code becomes part of the Axiomatic_AI codebase, specifically focused on creating interfaces that enable broader academic collaboration.

This model represents a new paradigm for scientific collaboration, where academic freedom and commercial development can coexist and mutually benefit each other through well-defined interfaces and clear intellectual property boundaries.

## Formal Verification

All projects incorporate a formal verification layer through integration with Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) like LEAN. This verification system is currently under development with Axiomatic AI scientist Ben Breen, and will provide:

- Mathematical consistency verification
- Formal proof of algorithm correctness
- Traceable derivation of physical models
- Verification of numerical approximation bounds

This verification layer ensures that all models and simulations produce mathematically sound results that can be trusted for both academic research and commercial applications.
